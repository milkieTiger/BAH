# Website Lifecycle

## Overview

The BAH website changes throughout the year according to the convention timeline.

Rather than deploying multiple versions of the website, the application operates under a single **Website State**. The frontend uses this state to determine which pages, features, and actions are available.

> **2027 Note:** The 2027 website is static-only (no API, no backend). Authentication, account creation, ticket registration, profile editing, and badge pickup are **not available** in 2027 — these features are reserved for the 2028 full-stack release. For 2027, submission pages (Art, Dealer, Panel) link to external Google Forms.
